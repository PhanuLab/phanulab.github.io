One approach to solving this issue is by finding and (re)using already existent materials.

It can be difficult to locate online resources that are appropriate for your teaching goals and that don\u2019t have licence or copyright constraints.

Well, a simple definition of training material is anything you would produce yourself (or reuse) as support for your teaching activity. These can be slides, datasets, videos, software, a GitHub repo, a collection of exercises, VMs/Containers, etc. In summary, any digital object which can be used to deliver a lesson, course or curriculum. In Chapter 2: Structure materials for FAIRness, we further describe types of materials and their levels of FAIRness as well. </p> <p>In 2018, a community of educators, trainers and training facilitators formed the ELIXIR FAIR Training focus group, which started the exercise of reflecting on what would be needed (what would it take) to make training FAIR and thus training materials FAIR. The result of this community exercise was published in the PLoS Computational Biology Ten Simple Rules collection with the paper 10 Simple Rules for Making Training Materials Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) 2. which is summarised in Figure 1. Overall, the rules were defined to help instructors and training facilitators make their first steps into making training materials FAIR, enabling others to find, (re)use, and adapt them. Much water has flowed under the bridge since then, and many people have tried to FAIRify (at least partially) their materials, and we still see and feel that it\u2019s not so simple to do all the steps at once.</p> <p>But if this is not so simple, why should we care to make training materials FAIR? The main reason behind it is to share. The more we share training materials, the more we spread our knowledge with trainers, and by sharing, we are giving back to the community in a virtuous circle. Going beyond this magnanimous idea, we can improve our course content based on the feedback we receive from peers and learners, and we can also learn from them and progress. By sharing, we provide inspiration for other trainers on how to run an exercise or how we explain a concept in our lectures, in the same way that we get inspiration from others, from books or websites. </p> <p>Figure 1: Ten simple rules for making training materials FAIR. Reproduced under CC-BY-SA 4.0 from Garcia et al2.</p> <p>Today, sharing training materials is not an issue anymore because a vast data ecosystem is available. However, training materials are very diverse and less integrated, which makes it harder for both computers and human beings to find them, and for humans to reuse them. Today, a quick web search can help us find videos (on YouTube), presentations (in Zenodo or FigShare), and whole course materials (on GitHub, in decentralised institutional websites, or open globally-scoped repositories). Given that these repositories accept a wide range of data types in a wide range of formats and impose minimal limits (or criteria) on the descriptors of the data deposition, it can be difficult to determine the context in which the content was created or used (for which course, which audience), and thus being able to reuse it.</p> <p>Consider the following example in the domain of single-cell omics training to obtain an idea of the obstacles faced. A search in TeSS (the ELIXIR\u2019s Training portal) material session using the expression \u201csingle-cell\u201d will generate a list of a minimum of ten items - they are thus Findable. The difficulty is to know which ones can be used and in which context. They are therefore Findable but may not be Accessible or Accessible under a restrictive licence which would not allow you to Reuse them in your teaching context. And if they are Accessible, they may be in a format that requires specific software that requires a paid licence as well, for instance, an exercise in Matlab, which makes Interoperability more difficult or impossible if you don\u2019t have that licence. </p> <p>Findable, Accessible, and Reusable are three principles that one can intuitively and easily visualise their application for training materials. Interoperability is a little less but becomes less mysterious when we reflect on training material formats, and the interoperations trainers or learners can do to reuse them. We must note however that the FAIR principles were depicted to be followed/applicable by humans and machines. Even though it\u2019s difficult to imagine a machine reusing your training materials to teach, we need the machines to facilitate and interface F, A, I and R. The following paragraph, copied/pasted from the FAIR principles 1, can further shed some light on our reflections:</p> <p>Humans and machines often face distinct barriers when attempting to find and process data on the Web. Humans have an intuitive sense of \u2018semantics\u2019 (the meaning or intent of a digital object) because we are capable of identifying and interpreting a wide variety of contextual cues, whether those take the form of structural/visual/iconic cues in the layout of a Web page, or the content of narrative notes. As such, we are less likely to make errors in the selection of appropriate data or other digital objects, although humans will face similar difficulties if sufficient contextual metadata is lacking. The primary limitation of humans, however, is that we are unable to operate at the scope, scale, and speed necessitated by the scale of contemporary scientific data and complexity of e-Science. It is for this reason that humans increasingly rely on computational agents to undertake discovery and integration tasks on their behalf. This necessitates machines to be capable of autonomously and appropriately acting when faced with the wide range of types, formats, and access-mechanisms/protocols that will be encountered during their self-guided exploration of the global data ecosystem. It also necessitates that the machines keep an exquisite record of provenance such that the data they are collecting can be accurately and adequately cited. Assisting these agents, therefore, is a critical consideration for all participants in the data management and stewardship process\u2014from researchers and data producers to data repository hosts.</p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Reflect on the FAIR principles and with your own words and examples, explain what are the FAIR principles and how they can be applied to your training materials.

Open Science started as a movement aiming to make scientific research \u2013 in the broadest sense, i.e. including publications, data, software, and educational resources \u2013 openly accessible to the public. Other related terms are Open Access and Open Data. Open Access is the term that relates to publications. It aims to give researchers, students, and the interested public free and immediate access to scholarly publications. </p> <p>Open Data aims to encourage sharing data and code on repositories to make research results transparent and reproducible. However, paraphrasing the GO-FAIR consortium: FAIR does not necessarily mean OPEN. The FAIR principles enable something to be as open as possible and as closed as necessary. The level of openness defined in a data access licence affects the accessibility (A) of the data but not F, I, or R. </p> <p>The following is an interesting explanation from the GO-FAIR consortium that will help you understand why FAIR is not equal to Open:</p> <p>The \u2018A\u2019 in FAIR stands for \u2018Accessible under well defined conditions\u2019. There may be legitimate reasons to shield data and services generated with public funding from public access. These include personal privacy, national security, and competitiveness. The FAIR principles, although inspired by Open Science, explicitly and deliberately do not address moral and ethical issues pertaining to the openness of data. In the envisioned Internet of FAIR Data and Services, the degree to which any piece of data is available, or even advertised as being available (via its metadata) is entirely at the discretion of the data owner. FAIR only speaks to the need to describe a process \u2013 mechanised or manual \u2013 for accessing discovered data; a requirement to openly and richly describe the context within which those data were generated, to enable evaluation of its utility; to explicitly define the conditions under which they may be reused; and to provide clear instructions on how they should be cited when reused [11]. None of these principles necessitate data being \u201copen\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d. They do, however, require clarity and transparency around the conditions governing access and reuse. As such, while FAIR data does not need to be open, in order to comply with the condition of reusability, FAIR data are required to have a clear, preferably machine readable, license. The transparent but controlled accessibility of data and services, as opposed to the ambiguous blanket-concept of \u201copen\u201d, allows the participation of a broad range of sectors \u2013 public and private \u2013 as well as genuine equal partnership with stakeholders in all societies around the world.</p> <p>To contextualise the GO-FAIR consortium paragraph above, you can imagine that several universities, institutions, companies or countries worldwide still have institutional or national regulations that stipulate that in-house products should remain within their walls and are only accessible internally. In this case, training materials produced by their professors and instructors\u2019 employees should remain their property, and only internal access would be granted to their students, learners, and citizens. These materials are thus not Open, but they can still be FAIRifyed to benefit these internal users and your reusability as a trainer. By FAIRifying training materials, we are also documenting how and when they were used, which can be handy to refresh our minds later when we teach the same content again and as a good practice in data management as well. </p> <p>Exercise</p> <p>Write down the main difference  between Open and FAIR.

The platforms shown are differently fit for the different phases, e.g. the Google Suite allows easy collaborative development but, because it is not possible to search for projects that our account is not linked to, it strongly limits the possibilities of sharing.  Moreover, the platforms might support in different ways the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) application to training materials, e.g. Zenodo supports findability of materials through rich metadata but the interoperability of these materials (how easy it is to modify, integrate or extend them) strongly depends on the format they are uploaded in.  In turn, also the FAIR principles are differently applicable to the four phases, e.g. training materials being findable in the development phase implies being findable by other potential trainers interested in contributing to the development, while in the sharing phase implies being findable to other potential trainers interested in consulting them after completion, for reuse. </p> <p>Potentially, one could compile a three dimensional table to discuss this topic, where the dimensions are: the training platforms, the four letters of FAIR, and the four phases of a project development.

To facilitate this, it is necessary that each element that will be shared can be easily and unambiguously identified and retrieved. The solution to this challenge is to assign each piece of information (training material, data, software, document, author etc.) a unique and permanent identifier (PID: Persistent Identifier).</p> <p>Imagine the following scenario: if you go to the opera, you leave your coat in the cloakroom in exchange for a ticket. From that moment on, you don\u2019t have to worry about where your coat is stored. You enjoy the performance, knowing that your ticket allows you to get your coat back. This ticket carries a unique identifier (a number on the ticket) issued by a trusted third party (the wardrobe attendant) who makes sure that this number is unique and remains assigned to your coat.</p> <p>As with the example about the coat, having a persistent identifier for training materials makes them easier to find amongst all the other materials in the same repository (i.e., the cloakroom). Furthermore, this facilitates a long-lasting material accessibility by working as backup. Additionally, using PIDs for the authors makes it easier to identify and acknowledge the contribution of individuals to developing and maintaining the materials. This also makes the materials easier to cite when it comes to reusing them.</p> <p>The PIDs must comply with a few rules:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Globally unique:</p> <p>To enable global uniqueness, a PID should comply with a controlled syntax to avoid clashes, for instance, by having namespaces that are governed by clearly defined authorities.

Metadata makes it easier for you and others to understand how a particular material or set of materials can be reused. </p> <p>Making training FAIR requires materials and sessions to be described with rich metadata. Ideally, this includes a universally agreed set of information. Many training communities, including Bioschemas and the Research Data Alliance (RDA) 1, are working towards defining these sets of information but broad agreement on the categories to be included is yet to be reached. In our paper 10 simple rules for making training materials FAIR 2 we used the Bioschema and RDA sets to create a list of the information (metadata) that is important for training materials.</p> <p>Table 1: Metadata that is important for training materials and guidance on what to include in each category (reproduced from Garcia et al 2020 2 under CC BY 4.0)</p> Type of metadata What to include Title Title of the training material. Contact details Author(s) name and contact details. Licensing/(re)use details Licence under which the materials are shared, and rules/conditions for (re)use and contribution. Preferred citation Instructions on how to cite your material. Description Overview of the subject matter, aims of the training and the language in which the training is delivered. Learning outcomes Statements that indicate what trainees should be able to do upon successful completion of the training. Target audience The intended audience, their prerequisite knowledge/skills, their general background, and how the training material will help them. Required resources Technical resources and related materials (software requirements, datasets, infrastructure requirements, etc.). Keywords Keywords or tags identifying the topic of the materials. Structure &amp; duration Description of the structure of the materials and setting in which to deliver them, including the time allocated to each part (lectures, exercises, etc.) Additional information Items that provide additional information about (re)use and delivery of the materials (e.g., general tips/guidance). Links and references Links and references that are relevant to the content, but not required for delivery of the materials. Date of last revision Date of last update of the materials, and the version. <p>For some of these categories the information is factual and it is obvious what to include (e.g. contact details, licence, date of last revision) but for other categories (e.g. learning outcomes, additional information) the content is more abstract and requires a little more thought.</p> <p>For these more abstract categories, the quality, or richness, of the information provided is important for enabling reuse. For example, in our cake analogy, if your recipe only included the title \u201cBest cake ever\u201d and a list of ingredients \u201cflour, eggs and milk\u201d and instructions to \u201ccombine and bake\u201d it would be difficult for someone to use the recipe to bake the same cake. Indeed they could end up with biscuits instead of a cake!

Where possible, keywords should be chosen from an agreed upon list of terms (i.e an ontology or controlled vocabulary) that is relevant to your field. This helps ensure that keywords are used consistently and reduces ambiguity. For biology and bioinformatics EDAM [@10.1093/bioinformatics/btt113] is an example of an ontology that includes agreed terms for data types, data identifiers, data formats, operations, and topics and you can use services like the Ontology Lookup Service to look up terms and keywords. </p> <p>You can learn more about ontologies in this video from the EMBL-EBI.</p>","tags":["Metadata","Contextual information","Reusability","Learning outcomes"]},{"location":"fair-chapters/chapter_07/#writing-learning-outcomes","title":"Writing learning outcomes","text":"<p>Writing learning outcomes in a consistent format makes them easier to understand and compare across different materials and sessions.

You might even consider adding an extra slide to your slide deck when you share it.  In fact what you include and how, really depends on the materials and training session in question.

Sharing metadata alongside your training materials makes it quicker and easier to review the materials. How you share this metadata depends on where you are sharing it.

We will define these roles in more detail in the next section and also clarify how credit is attributed for each of them. Attributing credit to these roles makes them (most often scientists) more visible, serves as a proof of their effort beyond pure research and can bring these scientists additional recognition. In addition, it clarifies the responsibilities of those who contributed to certain content of the training material and the training session and thus allows trainers who will re-use the training material to contact these people with potential follow-up questions. It makes those who contributed to the material personally accountable for their contributions. Beyond the individual author, Teacher/trainer and contributor, the funder(s), developing organisation or community play a role in the longer term maintenance of the materials. In the end, attributing contact creates a community of trainers and contributors, which not only makes your course material better, but it\u2019s also a great way together. </p> <p>All of the different roles are related to each other. The author(s) initiate and generate the material, and the trainer interacts with the learners. Contributors interact with the authors and trainers in order to improve the material.

However, it automates many other things, including HTTPS certificate provisioning on our domain via Let\u2019s Encrypt.</p> <p>There are several somewhat related approaches using GitHub Actions for automating the deployment of MkDocs-generated sites, usually with the Material theme, to GitHub Pages. These guides are not only found on blogs written by enthusiasts; the official Getting started section of the Material for MkDocs documentation describes the usage of GitHub Actions for deployment and provides a generic YAML file for that purpose. Using this approach avoids the requirement to run the <code>build</code> and <code>gh-deploy</code> steps locally; GitHub Actions does both on GitHub\u2019s CI/CD servers, where the free plan offers 2000 minutes of GitHub-hosted runners per month. As many sites build in less than a minute, this amount allows from 50 to 100 builds and deployments per day, which is quite a bit more than most sites require. Additionally, the repository layout remains the same as it would be if the build and deployment steps were done locally; the <code>main</code> branch contains the site source in Markdown and the <code>gh-pages</code> branch contains the site files that get built for serving.</p> <p>Since this summer, GitHub offers publishing Pages using a custom Actions workflow as a public beta, which was a unique feature of GitLab Pages for years. I thought that it would be interesting to see if we could use the existing GitHub Actions workflow configuration for Jekyll and simply replace the Jekyll build step with the MkDocs build step. This would streamline the usage of MkDocs with GitHub Pages, and, in particular, eliminate the requirement for publishing the site from a separate <code>gh-pages</code> branch, offering a Jekyll-like experience.</p> <p>Let\u2019s see how far we can get. Without going into details about the syntax for GitHub Actions, here is the starting workflow configuration file for Jekyll:</p> <pre><code># Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages\nname: Deploy Jekyll with GitHub Pages dependencies preinstalled\non:\n# Runs on pushes targeting the default branch\npush:\nbranches: [\"main\"]\n\n# Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab\nworkflow_dispatch:\n\n# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages\npermissions:\ncontents: read\npages: write\nid-token: write\n\n# Allow one concurrent deployment\nconcurrency:\ngroup: \"pages\"\ncancel-in-progress: true\n\njobs:\n# Build job\nbuild:\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nsteps:\n- name: Checkout\nuses: actions/checkout@v3\n- name: Setup Pages\nuses: actions/configure-pages@v2\n- name: Build with Jekyll\nuses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1\nwith:\nsource: ./\ndestination: ./_site\n- name: Upload artifact\nuses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1\n\n# Deployment job\ndeploy:\nenvironment:\nname: github-pages\nurl: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nneeds: build\nsteps:\n- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\nid: deployment\nuses: actions/deploy-pages@v1\n</code></pre> <p>The highlighted lines are Jekyll-specific. We can easily replace these lines with the Python setup Action, the installation of MkDocs and Material for MkDocs (using pip), the installation of the optional dependencies required for the generation of social cards (that is, Pillow and CairoSVG), the optional caching setup for the downloaded fonts and the generated social cards, and, finally, the MkDocs site build command.</p> <p>In this case, since we want a drop-in replacement for Jekyll so that the remaining commands work perfectly, we will perform the MkDocs build using the <code>mkdocs.yml</code> configuration file in the current directory and write the built site output files into the <code>_site</code> directory.</p> <pre><code># Sample workflow for building and deploying a MkDocs site to GitHub Pages\nname: Deploy MkDocs with GitHub Pages dependencies preinstalled\non:\n# Runs on pushes targeting the default branch\npush:\nbranches: [\"main\"]\n\n# Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab\nworkflow_dispatch:\n\n# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages\npermissions:\ncontents: read\npages: write\nid-token: write\n\n# Allow one concurrent deployment\nconcurrency:\ngroup: \"pages\"\ncancel-in-progress: true\n\njobs:\n# Build job\nbuild:\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nsteps:\n- name: Checkout\nuses: actions/checkout@v3\n- name: Setup Pages\nuses: actions/configure-pages@v2\n- name: Setup Python\nuses: actions/setup-python@v4\nwith:\npython-version: '3.11'\n- name: Install MkDocs and Material for MkDocs\nrun: pip install mkdocs[i18n] mkdocs-material\n- name: Install Pillow and CairoSVG (required for social card generation)\nrun: pip install pillow cairosvg\n- name: Setup caching\nuses: actions/cache@v3\nwith:\nkey: ${{ github.sha }}\npath: .cache\n- name: Build site (_site directory name is used for Jekyll compatiblity)\nrun: mkdocs build --config-file ./mkdocs.yml --site-dir ./_site\n- name: Upload artifact\nuses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1\n\n# Deployment job\ndeploy:\nenvironment:\nname: github-pages\nurl: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest\nneeds: build\nsteps:\n- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages\nid: deployment\nuses: actions/deploy-pages@v1\n</code></pre> <p>And that\u2019s it! There is no more requirement for the <code>.nojekyll</code> file as Jekyll never gets ran in the build process. There is also no more separate <code>gh-pages</code> branch that the built files get pushed to, so there is also no more worry whether the site builds over time will add up to the 1 GB soft limit.</p> <p>Finally, if you want to use a custom domain, having the <code>CNAME</code> file in the repository root or the <code>docs</code> subfolder will no longer have the desired effect; the domain has to be configured through the repository settings or using the API.</p> <p>Updated on 2022-11-25: changed Python version from 3.10 to 3.11, resulting in faster docs builds (see Faster CPython for details).</p> <p>Updated on 2022-12-03: changed caching to use <code>github.sha</code> instead of <code>github.ref</code>, enabling rebuilds of social cards when site contents change.</p>","tags":["git","web server","letsencrypt","markdown","mkdocs"]},{"location":"keywords/","title":"Keywords list","text":"<p>Here\u2019s a lit of used keywords:</p>"},{"location":"keywords/#academic-english","title":"Academic English","text":"<ul> <li>English for Academic and Specific Purposes</li> </ul>"},{"location":"keywords/#accessibility","title":"Accessibility","text":"<ul> <li>1.
