The mentioned technologies are mainly developed by notable individuals and organizations at GitHub. We acknowledge our sincere gratefulness and huge appreciation for their hardworks and efforts. Our developments and our teaching preparation would have taken more unnecessary resources if without the indirect assistances provided unknowningly to us. Thank you very much.
