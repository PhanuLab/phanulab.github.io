# MkDocs / Use Site #

Once the website is deployed, features will be available based on the
theme that is used, for example
[Material theme](material-theme.md).

The remainder of this page contains the following sections:

*   [Searching the Site](#searching-the-site)
*   [Printing a Page](#printing-a-page)
*   [Save a Page to a File](#save-a-page-to-a-file)
*   [Share Documentation](#share-documentation)

-----------------

## Searching the Site ##

If the MkDocs theme that is configured provides a search feature,
then the search tool can be used to search for keywords on the site.
Searching is generally pretty basic but will work well if the search word is specific enough.
A list of matching document sections will be listed and can be selected.

## Printing a Page ##

One of the downsides of MkDocs documentation is that it is necessary to print each web page,
whereas a full manual might consist of hundreds of pages in a PDF.
However, the benefits of interactive/navigable/linked documentation are deemed
more useful than long documents, especially because people seldom print long documents.

Pages in MkDocs websites can be printed in the normal manner by selecting the ***Print*** feature
in the web browser.  Typically the page will be printed without the menus and navigation content.

## Save a Page to a File ##

It may be desirable to, for example, email a single page to a third party or archive the document as if viewed.
The following sections describe how to save the file using common browsers.

### Chrome Browser ###

1.  Print the file using the ***Print*** menu or `Ctrl-P`.
2.  Select ***Change...*** to change the printer.
3.  Select ***Save as PDF*** from the printer names.
4.  Press the ***Save*** button and enter a filename for the PDF.

## Share Documentation ##

One of the benefits of publishing static documentation websites is that sharing the documentation
involves sharing the URL link to the website.
Therefore, visit the documentation page online, copy the browser link into an email, text, tweet, or other communication,
and share the documentation.

More skilled collaborators can contribute to the documentation via the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-learn-mkdocs).
