# notes-local

This folder contains notes for the local repository working files.
**Files other than this `README.md` will not be committed to the repository.**

For example, create a file named `Cygwin` to indicate that the repository is maintained
with Cygwin, or `GitBash` to indicate it is maintained with Git Bash.
This is important because they each handle end of line and file permissions differently
and mixing environments can cause issues.
