# MkDocs / Configuration #

A MkDocs website is configured using a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file in the main folder.

*   [MkDocs Configuration File](#mkdocs-configuration-file)
*   [Theme Configuration Settings](#theme-configuration-settings)

-------------------

## MkDocs Configuration File ##

The MkDocs configuration file is named `mkdocs.yml` and should be created in the main folder of a MkDocs project.
For example, see the location in the
[GitHub repository for this documentation](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-learn-mkdocs/tree/master/mkdocs-project).
Consequently, the `mkdocs.yml` file and `docs` folder that contains markup files for website content exist in the same folder.

See the [MkDocs Configuration documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/)
for an overview of configuration settings.

## Theme Configuration Settings ##

In addition to the MkDocs configuration settings,
refer to the configuration settings for the theme that is chosen for the documentation.
These settings will override the more general MkDocs configuration settings.
For example, see:

*   [Configuring Material Theme](material-theme.md#configuring-material-theme)
