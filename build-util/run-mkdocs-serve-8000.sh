# The above line ensures that the script can be run on Cygwin/Linux even with Windows CRNL

# The most recent version of this script is saved with Open Water Foundation owf-learn-mkdocs GitHub repository.
# If changes are implemented, the version in owf-learn-mkdocs/build-util should be updated as the global master.
# If necessary, run 'dos2unix' or 'unix2dos' (or equivalent) to ensure that line endings are OK in the copied script.

# This script attempts to find a suitable Python and mkdocs module for cygwin, Git bash, and Linux.
# The script is assumed to be installed in one of two configurations, for example:
#
# Option 1 - repository is dedicated to the documentation:
#
# main-repo-folder/
#   mkdocs-project/
#     mkdocs.yml
#   build-util/
#     this-script
#   doc/
#   site/
#
# Option 2 - repository contains more than the documentation and documentation is in a top-level folder,
# for example:
#
# main-repo-folder/
#   doc-dev-mkdocs-project/
#     mkdocs.yml
#     build-util/
#       this-script
#     doc/
#     site/
#
# In either case, a standard MkDocs folder structure is assumed with 'mkdocs.yml' configuration file,
# 'docs/' folder for source files, and 'site/' folder for MkDocs-generated static website.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
