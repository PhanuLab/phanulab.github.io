# Open Water Foundation / Learn MkDocs #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to use the MkDocs software,
which creates static documentation websites from Markdown source files.
A static website can be viewed on a local computer and can be published to the web.
Such documentation can be developed for software products such as developer and user documentation.
Documentation can also be created for other projects where navigable documentation is desirable.

This documentation has been written based on experience using MkDocs at the Open Water Foundation.

The documentation that you are reading has itself been created with MkDocs.
